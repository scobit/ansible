Ansible is a configuration management tool
Автоматизирует усправление конфигурирацией в инфраструктуре

Ansible не профилируется на разворачивании инфраструктуры, это лучше делает Terraform

Ansible нужен для того, чтобы быть уверенным что текущее состояние управляемого объекта соотвествует
желаемому состоянию определённому в Ansible

управление состоянием (конфигурацией) - это Ansible

Альтернатива:

Puppet
Chef
SaltStack

Ansible is a devops tool потому что Управляет конфигурацией как кодом

Позволяет легко разворачивать конфигурацию в раличных средах

Использует yaml плейбуки

В качетве гаранта верности кода должны редатироваться через git


Ansible control node

Control node - хост где установлен ansible

Понятие оператор ansible, работает на control node

С Control node конфигурация распростроняется на управляемые объекты

Способы установки:
 - git репозиторий - lastest stable
 - python pip3 установка - laster and greates
 
 lastest and greatest isn't always stable
 
 Рекомендация - установка из репозитория ОС
 
Ansible 2.10 - возможность работы с коллекциями стала по умолчанию доступна

модули и коллекции - это разные вещи

cat /etc/redhat-release

dnf install epel-release

ansible stores in epel

Extra packages for Enterprise Linux

dnf install -y ansible

Ansible dependencies are all python 3 based packages

ansible is dedeloped on top of python

we ned python stack in order to work with ansible

ansible --version


#### find packages 
dnf provides */pip

dnf install python3-pip

pip3 install ansible

недостаточк pip3 - установка в обход встроенного механизма установки ПО
К примеру альтернативное расположение файлов после установки

control node - Это не сервер, а рабочая станция оператора

Control node Требуется python

managed nodes упраляется control node

managed node requirements
remote access - ssh default (etc)
dedicated user account
privilege escalation

For convenient
use ssh keys fow passwordless connction to remote hosts
use passwordless privilege escalation

for secure managemtn
use -k cmd option to prompt for ssh password
use -K cmd option to prompt for privilege escalation password

Ansible tower - allows to cache passwords


Inventory

DNS and /etc/hosts are generic solutions that provide hostname to IP address resolving

Inventory nedds
to identify managed hosts
to define hosts groups to be used by ansible
to define variables (considered deprecated)

default inventory is in /etc/ansible/hosts

project based inventory is common, and inv files can be referred to using the -i inventoryFileName cmd line option

#### Ad-hoc

it's quick it's easy

dependencies cannot manage very well using ad-hoc

in ad hoc commands we are using modules

modules - perform specifi tasks

modules - kety feature of ansible

idempotentcy - свойство, при повторном выполнении таска результат выполнения будет одним и тем же и не важно менялось ли среда исполнения или нет


ansible ad-hoc command is a command-line-only solution to perform
ansible tasks  on managed hosts

ansible modules can be used in a add-hoc commands

always recomended to use the most pecific module you can find, 
as generic modules are not idempotent

минус ансибл, модулей болеее 3000 тысяч

while we are wotk with modules we nedd to address modules by name

since ansible 2.10 modules are part of collections

порог, есть значительная разница между ansible 2.9 and 2.10

to refer to module name in 2.10 and later 
a fq collection name is used like ansible.builtin.command

in ansible 2.9 and earlier pnly the last part of this name is used

ansible.builtin.command is a generic module that allows you to run any command using ansible



ansible.builtin.shell is like command but uses a bash shell 
which allows you to run shell features like pipes and redirects



ansible.builtin.user is a specific module for managing user accounts


ansible.builtin.copy is used to copy files

Setting up linux managed hosts with ad hoc commands

hosts requirements
ssh is runjing and reachable
there is a user with administrative privileges

ansible aad hoc commands can be used to configure managed hosts in an easy way


Setting up managed nodes

 - ensure ssh is running on the hosts
 include host names in inventory
 create the ansible user on manged nodes
 set a password for this user
 configure ssh key-based login
 ssh-keygen
 ssh-copy-id
 
 configure privilege escalation

###
make sure that nodes are available with ssh and hostname are resolved via dns or etc/hosts

create a file with the name inventory and following contents
ubuntu
ansible1
ansible2

to set up ubuntu with a user with the name ansible 
use the following command 

ansible -i inventory ubuntu -m user -a "name=ansible create_home=yes" -u student -b -k -K

on ubuntu workstation

apt install openssh-server

systemctl status sshd

inventory groups

vim inventory

ubuntu
[rocky]
ansible1
ansible2

every ad hoc command starts with ansible command 

at this part ansible don't know where to find inventory???

by default in ubuntu user created without home directory

-b become - run this command with escalated privileges

-k going to prompt for an ssh password

-K is going to prompt for a sudo password as well

if we press enter on become password - will be used ssh password

changed true - means that it changed something

## another way rocky machine

ansible -i inventory asible1 -m user -a "name=ansible" -u root -k

В rocky по умолчанию домашний каталог пользователя созлдаётся

as we use root user we don't need become privileges
so we don't nedd -b and -K


Set up password for the user
ubuntu:
ansible -i inventory ubuntu -m shell -a "echo 'ansible:password' | chpasswd" - u student -b -k -K

rocky:
ansible -i inventory ansible1 -m shell -a "echo password | passwd --stdin ansible" -u root -k

now using the local user ansible, create an ssh key pair and press enter to all questions

ssh-keygen

use ssh-copy-id to copy the key pairs to the managed nodes

ssh-copy-id bubuntu; ssh-copy-id ansible1


testing

ansible -i inventory all -m command -a "id" -u ansible


Ansible Failed
"Using a SSH password instead of a key is not possible because Host Key checking is enabled and sshpass does not support this. Please add this hosts's fingerprint to your known hosts file to mange this host"

If ansible receives a host key fingerprint from a managed host 
that it doen't know yes, Ansible is going to refuse connection.

We can change this through the ansible.cfg

workaround 
ssh ansible

Fingerprint - is telling us hey i can't verify the authenticity.
Are you sure, yem i am sure and that's all that i need

The thing is that i don't nedd to login, i need these host keys
to be stored 

they are stored in .ssh/known_hosts


ssh-keygen


ssh-copy-id ubuntu

ssh-copy-id  ansible1

ssh-copy-id  ansible2




########## last part

vim /etc/hosts
ip	fqdn	hostname


ping ansible host to check


Setting up privilege escalation

To securely escalate privileges, use the -b -K command line options

to conveniently escalate privileges, consider configuring passwordless sudo

to do so with ansible, create a sudo configuration file locally

next use the ansible copy module to cpy configuration file to managed hosts

read about sudoers file and meaning off ALL etc

echo 'ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' > /tmp/sudoers

sudo cp /tmp/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/ansible

ansible rocky -i inventory -u root -k -m copy -a "src=/etc/sudoers dest=/etc/sudoers.d/ansible"

ansible ubuntu -i inventory -u student -k -b -K -m copy -a "src=/tmp/sudoers dest=/etc/sudoers.d/ansible"


ansible ubuntu -i inventory -u student -k -b -K -m file -a "path=/etc/sudoers.d state=directory"

test
ansible -i inventory all -m command -a "ls -l /root"

ansible -i inventory all -m command -a "ls -l /root" -b

Ansible Failed
Permission deniednon-zero return code

means that we make some sudo command wtihout specifing -b 
even if we have passwordless sudo rights

machines are now in managable state

we can automate input options lijke -b - K etc

#########

ansible.cfg
a convenient configuration file that helps you to set some default values for your current product or for all of your system

If you create ansible.cfg in projecr directory - that file will always be used

Managing assets with ansible, you will need to provide different settings

settings can be provided at different levels:
 - on the command line
 in playbooks
 in ansible.cfg
 

A default ansible.cfg is provided in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

specific ansible.cfg files can be created in project derictories

settings that are made at a more specific level will always overwrite the generic settings

ansible --version
can show which ansible.cfg file we use

dnf install -y git

git clone https://github.com/sandervanvugt/ansiblecvc

vim ansible.cfg

testing

ansible all -m command -a "ls -l /root"

comand line settings always win ansible.cfg setting

Generic rule in Ansible - the most specific settings will always win

## Setting up Windows as a Managed Host


ansible can manage all windows versions from WIndows 7 and Windows server 2008

in ansible a specific set of modules is provided to manage wwindows assets

# Preparing a windows hosts
 - os
 - user with admin privileges
 
powershell:
winrm quickconfig
type yes


# Set up WinRM, using the script that is provided on
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_setup.html

WinRM setup part
copy script and run in PowerShell

this will set up basic authentification configuration


Verify using winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener and verify that http and https listeners are available

Windows cannot user SSH, windows is using windows remote manager

as default remote management solution

in windows control panel create ansible user, set password and make this user an administrator

Server Manager -> Local Server -> IE Enhanced Security Configuration - make Off 
This conf makes IE unusable


Windows supports different authentification protocols

If authentification has benn configured to a strict protocol 
on Windows, you may have to set up Ansible accordingly

 - basic: only sipports locacl accounts - do not use
 - certificate: only supports local accounts - do not use
 - kerberos: only works for AD accounts
 - NTLM: works for local and AD accounts
 - CredSSP: offers best support for local and AD accounts
 
If you have isues with authentifications use ansible_winrm_transport: credssp (or anything elase) in ansible.cfg

Preparing the Control Hosts

on ansible control, create windows project directory with an ansible.cfg and an inventory 
https://github.com/sandervanvugt/ansiblecvc
cd windows


set up /etc/hosts for host name resolution to rthe windows box - notice that windows firewall disallows ping incoming

on ansible control: sudo pip3 install pywinrm

on ansible control: ansible win -i inventory -m win_ping

make sure the passwords math

check facts:
ansible win -i inventory -m setup

dnf search python | grep pip

dnf install python3-pip

Lab solution

vim /etc/hosts
IP	FQDN	HOSTNAME

ping hostname

cp ansiblecvc/ansible.cfg .


add host to inventory

ansible tower -m user -a "name=ansible" -u root -k

systemctl status sshd

ansible tower -m shell -a "echo password | passwd --stdin ansible" -u root -k"

ssh-copy-id tower

ansbile tower -u root -k -m copy -a "src=/tmp/sudoers dest=/etc/sudoers.d/ansible"

ansible tower -m command -a "ls -l /root"

##############

ad hoc commands versus playbooks

When to use Ad-hoc commands

in an ad-hoc command, ansible modules are used to perform tasks on managed hosts

ad-hoc command are perfect for running one task on a manageed hosts 
 - initial hosts setup
 - checking configuration on hosts
 
ad-hoc commands are also perfect to learn how easy ansible really is 

playbooks are the way to implement more complex taks where dependency relations have to be managed

Understanding Ansible Modules

an ansible module is a python script that will be executed on the managed host

more than 3000 modules are available in ansible

modules can be offered as such (pre Ansible 2.10) or as a part of a collection (Ansible 2.10 and later)


Running ad-hoc commands

use the ansible command to run ad-hoc commands

while running the ansible command, an enventory must be present, and you must specify which host to address

you will also use the -m option to address a specific module, and -a for module arguments

ansible -i inventory windows -m ansible.windows.win_ping
ansible -i inventory all -m ansible.builtin.command -a reboot
ansible -i inventory rocky1 -m ansible.builtin.user -a "name=anna state=present"

ansible -i inventory all -m ansible.builin.command -a reboot
ansible -i inventory all -m ansible.builin.command -a id
ansible -i inventory all -m ansible.builin.command -a uptime

ansible rocky -m ansible.builtin.user -a "name=anna state=present"

ansible rocky -m user -a "name=anna state=present"

FQCN - fully qualified collection names


Understanding Module Names

Before ansible 2.10, modules were referred to just by their name

ansible all -m command -a reboot

since ansible 2.10, modules are a part of ansible collections

ansible all -m ansible.builtin.command -a reboot

collections allow for better management of large amounts of modules

for compatibility reasons, the old module names can still be used

Linsting Modules

Pre-2.10: ansible-doc -l
2.10 and later: ansible-doc -t module -l

Exploring Some Essential Modules

ansible.builtin.command is the default module and runs arbitrary commands on the managed nodes, but not through a shell

The default module means that you don't have to specify -m command and just use -a followed by the command, it'll also work

ansible.builtin.command is the default module and runs arbitrary commands on the managed nodes, but not through a shell

ansible.builtin.shell is an alternative to command. and should be used when shell items like pipes and redirects are required

ansible.builtin.raw runs the command without the nedd for python being present on the managed nodes

ansible.builtin.package is a generic module for managing packages

ansible.builtin.user allows for user management


raw in the past was useful because it allowed you to install python on managed nodes that did not have python yet

Nowadays python is a part of the base linux installation of all distributions

Best Practice!

Always use the most specific module you can find

using generic modules often leads to problems as these don't do well in situations where the desired state already exists

this is referred to as idempotency: meaning that if the current state already matches the desire state, the module will still work as expected and won't fail

Demo: performing Tasks Using Modules

ansible ansible1 -m command -a "rpm -qa | grep python"

ansible ansible1 -m shell -a "rpm -qa | grep python"

ansible all -m copy -a 'content="hello world" dest=/etc/motd'

ansible all -a "cat /etc/motd"

# works a little bit slow rather than sp[ecific package modules
ansible all -m package -a "name=nmap state=latest"

ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started enabled=yes"


# Using ansible-doc
ansible-doc has doc not only for modules, it has doc for about everything


module documentation is in ansible-doc

use ansible-doc [-t module] -l to show a list of all modules

use ansible-doc modulename for a detailed desription of the module and its options

notice the example section that exists at the end of the documentation for each of the modules

arguments also knows as options

= in doc means mandatory options

Understanding Idempotency

Idempotence is a property of operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result

ansbile is about state management and desired result  should be

in ansible it means that a module should run successfully, where it makes no difference if the current state already meets the desired state or not

many ansible modules are idempotent by nature, but some are not

avoid using command, shell or raw as they are not idempotent by nature

Demo: Expoloring Idempotency

As user ansible on control, make sure you are in the directory that has inventory and ansible.cfg files

Type ansible all -m ping

Type ansible all -m user -a "name=lisa"

type ansible all -m command -a "useradd lisa"

ansible all -m user -a "name=lisa state=absent"


Lab: using ad-hoc commands

Use add-hoc commands to request ansible facts for your Windows Server

Use ad-hoc commands to create a user anna on your Windows Server

ansible-doc -l | grep ^win

ansible-doc -l | grep ^win | grep facts

ansible windows -m win_disk_facts

ansible windows -m win_product_facts

ansible win -m win_product_facts

ansible-doc win_user

ansible win -m win_user -a "name=anna password=Aa123456$$"


Understanding playbooks

Playbooks are used to run multiple tasks in order on multiple hosts

Playbooks are the way to go to define dependency relations between tasks

Playbooks can also be used to implement conditional structures, where tasks are only executed if specific conditions are true

Understanding playbook Elements

In a playbook, one or more plays are defined 

Each play has a header thet defines different properties, including the hosts on which it has to run

In a play, one or more tasks are defined

Playbooks are written in YAML which makes it easy to define relations between parent and child elements

Understanding YAML
in YAML, indentation is used to identify the relation between parent and child objects, which are specified as key: value pairs

you may also find old notations, which is key equals value
with key common value is the prefered notation nowadays

Data elements at the same level in the hierarchy must have the same indentation and that makes it easy to find relation between different resources

Items that are children (properties_ are indented more than the parents

If a specific module argument can have multiple values, these values typically start with hyphen - recall those arrays

Indentation happens using spaces. Using tabs is not allowed

Configure vim for indentation by adding the following to
~/.vimrc
autocmd FileType yaml setlocal ai ts=2 sw=2 et

this is making sure that my indentation is happening using two spaces

Understanding playbook elements

The relations are defined using indentation
Yask properties are defined using key:value pairs
Most key can have one string value
Some keys have a list (array) value
When a list value is defined, each item is identified using a hypen

In a playbook you will always start with a play and as a playbook can contain multiple plays 
Every play is starting with hyphen

If we want we can create multiple plays
That makes sense in particular, if you want to use a couple of different settings

In a play header you identify the target host 

# first 3 lines - minimum play header
vim sample.yaml
- name: myplay
  hosts: rocky
  tasks:
  - name: task1
    debug:
	  msg: hello world
  - name: task2
    debug:
	  msg: hello task2  

- name: ubuntusettings
  hosts: ubuntu
  tasks:
  - name: hello ubuntu
    debug:
	  msg: hello ubuntu
	  
	  
ansible-playbook sample.yaml

Facts gathering - this is where ansible is going to discover properties of the managed hosts

We can speed it up by using fact cash.

Fact gathering can be useless in some playbooks

ok - means nothing was changed

Running playbooks

To run a playbook, the ansible-playbook command is used

Syntax check is not neededm you'll be alerted if anything is wrong with your playbook

Use -v up to four times for increased verbosity messages

minus v 2 times will tell you which files i used

minus v 4 times - complete debugging information about everything

Be default playbooks do not write any output log
only standard output 

Command line version of Ansible also known as Ansible engine 
output messages are printed on the screen

Gave a look at install_and_start_httpd.yaml

git clone
cd basics

Playbook extions can be yml and yaml

--- 
YAML identifier that is telling your YAML interpreter thet the code is staring here

package module doen't allow you to use some of the specifics 
that may be available in specific modules like apt and dnf
but it will work against different Linux targets

---
- name: install start and enable httpd
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: install package
    package:
	  name: httpd
	  state: latest
  - name: start and enable service
    service:
	  name: httpd
	  state: started
	  enable: yes


 
ansible-playbook install_and_start_httpd.yaml

Fact gathering can be turned off

Because facts can be used as variables inside your playbook

apache2 in ubuntu, httpd in RHEL

Changed means that the desired state is desribed in the playbook 
did not meet the current state of the managed machine and if change was required.

If the desired state already met with current state then you will see, okay, instead.

Default behavior in errors:
if task execution on a specific host is failing then further task execution on the same host will be skipped

Fact gathering counts as a task as well

Running playbook multiple times should give the exact same result

Idempotent nature of the playbook

Okay meaning that the managed machine state already met with the desired state and no changes were necessary

On playbook execution many things happen:
 - fact gathering
 task execution
 play recap
 
Notice that a good playbook is written to be idempotent

Idempotency is really important


A playbook can define one or more plays

Defining multi-pay playbooks makes sense in the following cases:
 - to write the playbook in a modular way
 - to limit the number of tasks that run in one play
 - to run sime tasks on the host, while others are running on another host
 = in a play header we can set different variables
 
 
have a look at run_and_test_httpd.yaml - multi-play playook

fact gathering is useful when you are going to use the variables that are gathered by fact gathering




The uri module is expecting a status code 200 if access is successful. 

By default the firewall is preventing httpd from being accessesd. 

ansible-doc firewalld

firewalld is specific for RedHat it won't work on ubuntu

boolean in ansible can be:
false no F f 
 
 
---
- name: install start and enable httpd
  gather_facts: false
  hosts: rocky
  tasks:
  - name: install package
    package:
	  name: httpd
	  state: latest
  - name: start and enable service
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
      enabled: yes
  - name: open port in firewall
    firewalld:
      service: http
      permanent: yes
      state: enabled
      immideate: yes

- name: test httpd accessibility
  become: False
  gather_facts: no
  hosts: localhost
  tasks: 
  - name: test httpd access
    uri: 
      url: http://rocky	




Understanding Playbook errors:

A play contains a series of tasks

task dependencies in general are very important

if a task fails to run on a specific host, futher execution of tasks in the failing play is aborted on that host
And there is a reason begind it - the futher tasks normally depend on the previous tasks. So if a previous task is failing it makes no sense to continue and that is why further execution will fail.

But we can use ignore_errors: True
Put it in play header

Undoing playbook Modifications

There is no easy way to undo modifications that have been applied by a playbook

This is because of the complex dependency relations that my exist between playbooks

The only way to undo a playbook, is writing a playbook that is doing the opposite actions in reversed order

vim failingtask.yaml

---
- name: demonstrate failing tasks
  gather_facts: no
  ignore_errors: true | yes
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: creating users the wrong way
    command: useradd anna 
  - name: creating users in right way
    user:
      name: anna
      	  
  - debug:
      msg: run me again and see if you get here
 

ansible-playbook failingtask.yaml


ansible always works on the return code of a command to determine whether or not something has changed

Idempotency is all about

desired state


Lab: automate setup of the vsftpd

write a playbook that meets the following requirements.
Use ansible-doc for additional information if needed.
 - install, start and enable the vsftpd service on all managed nodes
 - open the firewalld firewall to allow access to this service
 
 run the playbook, and observe working of the playbook
 
 run the playbook one more time and again, observee the working of the playbook
 
vim lesson3.yaml
---
- name: install and run vsftpd
  gather_facts: no
  hosts: rocky
  tasks:
  - name: install the package
    package:
	  nameL vsftpd
  - name: run the service
    service:
	  name: vsftpd
	  state: started
	  enabled: yes
  - name: open firewall
    firewalld:
	  service: ftp
	  state: enabled
	  permanent: yes
	  immediate: yes 

firewall-cmd --get-services

####
Ansible Tower - the web-based Ansible management platform

Ansible Tower is a Red Hat web-based platform that manages Ansible from a web interface

The purpose is to make it easier to work with ansible and to add 
some features as well

Ansible Tower adds some features that are not integrated in ansible engine, the command line version of ansible:
 - Role-Based Access Control for instance. You can use users as well as teams and to provide permissions to the users and teams to perform specific tasks
 - Caching of passwords
 - workflow designer - which is the option to create a conditional workflow between different tasks. That is like execute task A, if task succeed, you execute task B, if it doesn't, you execute task C
 
AWX is the open-source upstream of Ansible Tower

Ansible Automation Platform is a Red Hat solution that bundles different ansbile components:
 - ansible engine: the command line version of ansible
 - ansible tower: the web-based ansible management interface
 - content collections: packages that bundle modules, roles and more
 - automation hub: a platform that hossts certified collections for ansible
 - automation analytics: integrated Red Hat insights for advanced ansible management and analysis



galaxy.ansible.com - the community website
but content is not certified

console.redhat.com
Home website for Ansible Automation Platform
requiere Red Hat credentials
you can get it from
developer.redhat.com


AWX is container based and you nedd a container orchestration platform

Tower installation requirements

Free evaluation licenses are available from Red Hat
 - Donwload the tar-ball
 - Rquest an evaluation license or use your Red Hat developer subscription (developers.redhat.com)
 
The ansible Tower (AWX) machine
 - 8 (4) GB RAM
 - 4 (2) vCPUs
 - 40 (20) GB  disk space
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS Stream
 
Installing Ansible Tower

wget https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz


# Extract the evaluation version tar-ball
tar xvf ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz



# Modify all password fields in the enventory file (4 fields) (type password word)
vim inventory

admin_password='password'
pg_password='password'
automationhub_admin_password='password'
automationhub_pg_password='password'


sudo ./setup.sh

Ansible Tower is installed by big install.yml playbook

Log in to the web UI: https://localhost
Login: admin
Password: from inventory file


Log in with your Red Hat credentials or provide the credentials file

Managing Machines with Tower

To reach out to managed machines with Tower, things are not really different from managing machines with Ansible Engine from the command line

Identifying the managed machines
 - On the Tower host, setup /etc/hosts name resolving (or DNS)
 
On the managed machines
Ensure sshd is running and accepts incomming connections (firewall)
Need a user account with sudo privileges
Need to set up password / SSH keys

Understanding Tower Main Components

Organization: a collection of managed devices

Users: administrative users that can be granted access to specific tasks

Inventories: managed servers. Can be created statically or dynamically 
 - click Setting -> License and check Host Remaining
 
Credentials: credentials that are used to log in to a managed machine.
Think of user with sudo privileges

Project: a collection of playbooks obtained from a certain location (such as Github)

Template: the job definition with all of its parameters. Must be launched or scheduled.


Understanding the Tower Workflow

(optional) Define an organization

create an inventory

configure credentials

set up a project

define a job template

run the job



configure /etc/hosts on tower server

ansible tower -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/etc/hosts"

ansible tower -a "cat /etc/hosts"

su - ansible

ssh-keygen

ssh-copy-id ansible1 etc

github repo:

https://github.com/sandervanvugt/tower



Managing Windows with Ansible Tower

There are no credentials through that allow you to specify that winrm needs to be used as the remote connection mechanism

To manage Windows, you create a Windows specific inventory, with variables set on that inventory:
ansible_connection: winrm
ansible_port:5986
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
optional:
ansible_winrm_transport: credssp

Understanding Windows Become

To manage Linux, you need privilege escalation

To manage windows, you need tj have a user with administrator privileges

if tasks are executed using such a user account, privilege escalation does not have to be disabled


Managing Windows with Ansible Tower

make sure that windows is in manageable state

create machine credentials to log in as the Windows based ansible user, using a password (not an ssh key)

next you will be able to run playbooks against Windows





Lab managing assets with tower

Install ansible Tower on RHEL 8

Add a new CentOS 7 based virtual machine and configure it so that ansible tower can manage it

set up tower to use the course git repository at 
https://github.com/sandervanvugt/tower

Use ansible Tower to run the run_and_test_httpd.yaml playbook on the new CentOS host

groups in inventory 

privikege escalation
