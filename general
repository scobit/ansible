The order in which a configuration file is located is as follows:

ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable)
ansible.cfg (per directory)
~/.ansible.cfg (home directory)
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (global)

The default host inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts but can be changed via the configuration file (as shown above) or by using the -i option on the ansible command.

ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml



logger command


# -C, --check           don't make any changes; instead, try to predict some of the changes that may occur
ansible-playbook --check myplaybook.yml


one-step-at-a-time: confirm each task before running
ansible-playbook --step myplaybook.yml


Similar to a shell script, you can make your Ansible playbook executable and add the following to the top of the file:
#!/bin/ansible-playbook


Use string quoting in playbooks to avoid issues with special characters within a string.
Logging is disabled by default. To enable logging, use the log_path parameter in the Ansible configuration file.

$ ansible-playbook --syntax-check myplaybook.yml

#install ansible

By default, Ansible uses native OpenSSH and connects to remote machines using your current user name, just as SSH does

ansible test -m ping -vvvv



vim hosts

# If you have multiple hosts following a pattern you can specify
# them like this:

#www[001:006].example.com

#db-[99:101]-node.example.com


ansible all -a "echo hello"

[WARNING]: Consider using the file module with state=touch rather than running 'touch'.  If you need to use
command because file is insufficient you can add 'warn: false' to this command task or set
'command_warnings=False' in ansible.cfg to get rid of this message.

$ ansible all -m ping -u bruce
# as bruce, sudoing to root (sudo is default method)
$ ansible all -m ping -u bruce --become
# as bruce, sudoing to batman
$ ansible all -m ping -u bruce --become --become-user batman

The default location for inventory is a file called /etc/ansible/hosts. You can specify a different inventory file at the command line using the -i <path> option.

$ ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10 -u username --become [--ask-become-pass]
If you add --ask-become-pass or -K, Ansible prompts you for the password to use for privilege escalation (sudo/su/pfexec/doas/etc).
