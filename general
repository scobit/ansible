The order in which a configuration file is located is as follows:

ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable)
ansible.cfg (per directory)
~/.ansible.cfg (home directory)
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (global)

The default host inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts but can be changed via the configuration file (as shown above) or by using the -i option on the ansible command.

ansible all --list-hosts



vim hosts

[webservers]
vm2
vm3

[dbservers]
vm4

[logservers]
vm5

[lamp:children]
webservers
dbservers


ansible web --list-hosts
